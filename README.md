## Technical Test for News UK Platform Engineers

Prerequisites: IDE of your choice, Docker

We want to create an app and deploy it using Docker.
Your job is to create a Javascript application that have the following paths:

- `/` - Homepage, should display some text.
- `/version` - Displays the current version of the application.
- `/nextVersion` - Increment the current version of the application and show both new and old versions.

Once the application is ready you need to dockerize it.

## Expected Outcome

You should be able to open the application while running on Docker in your browser and have the three working paths described above.

BONUS: Get the version from a second container.
